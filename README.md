# PFSCon
PFSCon is a convention management application that puts key information for the convention (scheduling, vendor list, map of the facility) in the palm of your hand. It was built using:
## React Native
## NodeJS
## PostgreSQL

It incorprates React-Navigation with nested Tab Navigation and Stack Navigation.

On the schedule page, the individual 'tables' include tappable links to the scenario's description. On the vendor page, the url's are tappable as well that takes the user out to the vendor's website using their default browser.
